# Employees React App

## No DB 

You can add or remove an employee, set his salary, add a promotion and/or a salary increase
But you will lose everything when updating the app.

You can try this app at https://employees-admin.herokuapp.com/ 
(Sometimes it works poorly, and outputs "There's nothing there, yet" try to refresh the page or wait for a while)
